# 🧩 Life Deck — Track Your Real-Life Activities

[Check it out](https://life-deck-2.netlify.app/)


**Life Deck** is a simple, manual activity tracker for your real life—like a personal time log or a "Steam Library" for everything you do.

Add activities such as reading, working out, gaming, studying, and track how much time you spend on each.  
Just **press Start before you begin**, and **Stop when you're done**—your time is recorded and added to your stats.

## What it does

- Lets you create activities (e.g. Reading, Studying, Gaming)
- Allows you to track time spent on each activity with a start/stop system
- Lets you organize activities into categories (e.g. all books under "Reading")
- Shows total time per activity and total time per category

---

## What it does *not* do

- It does not track time automatically
→ You must manually press Start/Stop for your activities
- It does not automatically complete achievements or stats
→ You create and check off your own progress — the app doesn't guess what you've done
- It’s not a to-do list, calendar, or habit tracker — it’s purely about logging and reflection

## Coming soon

- Custom Stats
→ Add your own data points to each activity (e.g. chapters read, calories burned, mood)
- Day Tracker / Timeline View
→ See a visual breakdown of how your day was spent, hour by hour
- Custom Achievements
→ Create and unlock your own goals like “Read 10 books” or “Workout 5x a week”

## Why?

Because it just feels cool to see the hours build up.
You’re working out, reading, grinding — and suddenly you see 120 hours logged next to something you love.
There’s no secret purpose. It’s just satisfying to see your time add up in one place.
